# Project - Currency Convertor - Updates
## 1.0.1 (2023-06-13)

### Changed
- The OpenRates.io API, as mentioned in the video on PRISM, is no longer available for use and has been deprecated by the provider.
- The openRates() function has been updated to use the https://exchangerate.host/#/ API instead.
- This API works in exactly the same format and does not require any change on part of the React application.
